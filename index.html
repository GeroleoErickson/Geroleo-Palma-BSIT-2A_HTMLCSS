                        institution committed to nation building, recognized

                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>A young man, barely 23 years old, had a vision of inculcating 
                        among the youth the qualities of competence and leadership, 
                        high moral and spiritual values and development of each individual 
                        into a total person. These would be acquired through an educational 
                        process guided by the philosophy of Dynamic Filipinism.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This philosophy has as its guiding tenets, the internalizing all 
                        that is good in the Filipino people: warmth, hospitality, 
                        innovativeness, and a high emotional quotient that has made 
                        Filipinos renowned in service oriented industries.” This young 
                        man, Don Mariano Fortunato Jhocson, guided by this vision, 
                        founded Colegio Filipino , now NATIONAL UNIVERSITY in August 01, 
                        1900, in Quiapo, City of Manila. It was the first non – sectarian 
                        and co – educational institution then. There were only a handful 
                        of students at that time in the fledgling School, and they were in 
                        the elementary and secondary (High School) levels. Don Mariano, 
                        in order to help the school grow, was teacher, director and janitor 
                        rolled into one.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In a short span of 5 years, he offered courses in Business – bookkeeping 
                        and accounting, convinced that thus armed, his students would be 
                        financially secure and respectable after graduation. This led to 
                        the changing of the name to Colegio Mercantil , awarding the diploma 
                        of Perito Mercantil . A short time later, the Philippine Law School 
                        was opened with the collaboration of the Lacson brothers. Don Mariano 
                        saw the dire need for training the youth for leadership and 
                        responsibility. He firmly believed that the discipline of Law would 
                        turn out men and women who would eventually be advocates for 
                        Philippine self government.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        In 1916, the Board of Trustees changed the name from Colegio 
                        Mercantil to National Academy. The growth of the Academy was 
                        continuous, added Liberal Arts which became the gateway to 
                        other disciplines that followed. After 21 years of educational 
                        service, on January 17, 1921, the Board of Trustees applied for 
                        and secured permission from the Department of Public Instruction 
                        to change the name of the National Academy to NATIONAL UNIVERSITY. 
                        On that same day, the University also installed Senator Camilo Osias, 
                        one of the most respected and outstanding Filipino educators as 
                        President of the University. Thereafter, the Colleges of Education 
                        and Commerce were opened in the same year. During the following years, 
                        the Colleges of Pharmacy and Dentistry were opened in 1922. The 
                        College of Engineering, offering initially Civil Engineering opened in 
                        1925 and the Normal School in 1930. Sanitary Engineering was initially 
                        offered in 1930.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        From July, 1945 its facilities have since continuously expanded and the 
                        following disciplines were added – Bachelor degrees in Chemical, 
                        Electrical, Industrial, Mechanical Engineering and Architecture 
                        and Arts. Master in Sanitery Engineering was also organized. 
                        Responding to the needs of industry and modern technology, the 
                        University started offering the following courses: Computer 
                        Science in 1990, Marine Engineering and in 1994 Computer Engineering 
                        and Electronics and Communications Engineering. College of Nursing 
                        was offered in 2004, Hotel and Restaurant Management in 2008 and 
                        Information Technology in 2009.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        On January 01, 1998, a disastrous fire razed four buildings of 
                        the University – the Main Building, Law and Commerce Building, 
                        Elementary Building and the Graduate School Building. The 
                        University was able to re-open its doors after three weeks of 
                        unrelenting restoration work. In the last quarter of year 2008, 
                        the SM Group of Companies acquired majority ownership of the 
                        National University. The all out support of the SM Group will 
                        help strengthen our institution as Higher Institution with new 
                        infrastructure, improved and upgraded laboratory, focused in 
                        academic excellence. Today, the University is engaged in a 
                        continuous modernization and upgrading program for its facilities, 
                        faculty and sports development.Our new University infrastructure is 
                        an 8 storey modern design building with two units of escalators and 
                        four units of elevators. NATIONAL UNIVERSITY is a founding member 
                        of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines (UAAP) and 
                        is a pioneer of the Philippine Association of Colleges and 
                        Universities (PACU). Its international affiliations and memberships
